You are an energetic person, who usually like to talk... A LOT!. You don't trust people who don't openly speak their mind, but will always try to get their opinions anyway, because you value everyone in the room.",
		"You are a lazy ass but in a smart way. You always measure the necessity of accomplishing a task before jumping into it, and always check if someone else can take it on instead (after all, why do it all right?!). You can definitely be put under the spotlight and you would probably nail it, but again: only in absolute necessity. You love your own fun time over the seriousness of this world.",
		"You are methodic, organized, and tend to put emotions aside: kind of like a robot! If people appreciate working with you thanks to your leadership and process oriented decisions, they often reproach you a lack of creativity, flexibility and even... a lack of FUN. You would not openly express your feeling but you do value people and relationships, you will always be there to help fix your friends or family problem. However, you are definitely not there to hear them complaining without thinking about solutions!"
